# <Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I used basic HTML,CSS,Git and Javascript to create a study guide for myself as a bootcamp student

- Building a basic website was a great introduction to the building blocks of coding as well as an introduction to the tools I would need to learn how to code.

- Through making the webpage I learned basic procedures in the coding workplace as well as the building blocks of a webpage and their deployment.
